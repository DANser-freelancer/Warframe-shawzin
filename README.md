# Warframe-shawzin
This is a shawzin "translator" that will convert written notes into shawzin code, currently up and running at:  
https://danser-freelancer.github.io/Warframe-shawzin/  
Made by [DANser-freelancer](https://github.com/DANser-freelancer?tab=repositories) (with javascript) after attempting to have somewhat of a decent song on shawzin and feeling like my life energy was completely sucked out.  
I have all the musical scales, quality of life features, clear rules, and a database of codes. If you want to add a new song just open an issue on github.
I have created a discord server for code requests and Warframe music fans in general https://discord.gg/VyjFwKn8AY.      
## Work in progress    
~And I am working on a custom bot for this server that will _possibly_ have a built in database of codes equal to the one on **Shawzin music compiler** website.~   
~Working on updating the Shawzin compiler to add a playable note sheet with sound, and upgrade the note tanslating parts.~          
~Working on better visuals, QoL, and better error recognition system (for interactable note sheet specifically).~              
~Working on more precise note info display.~           
Working on offline mode.               
Working on getting hq shawzin pictures.          
~Working on feature to copy&paste note sheet notes from one position to another.~        
~Working on upgrading shawzin code import.~
