# Warframe-shawzin
This is a shawzin "translator" that will convert written notes into shawzin code, currently up and running at: https://danser-freelancer.github.io/Warframe-shawzin/
\n Made by me (with javascript) after attempting to have somewhat of a decent song on shawzin and feeling like my life energy was completely sucked out. I have all the musical scales, quality of life features, clear rules, bug support, and a database of codes.
Credit to https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VvlM4IQr8bfUV8pCJMVNRaG6piJTR9_t-xq7wQaxpho/edit for having this whole shawzin code thing figured out. 
I have created a discord server for code requests and Warframe music fans in general https://discord.gg/VyjFwKn8AY, 
and I am working on a custom bot for this server that will possibly have a built in database of codes equal to the one on Shawzin compiler website.
