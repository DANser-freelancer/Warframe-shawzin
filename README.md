# Warframe-shawzin
This is a shawzin "translator" that will convert written notes into shawzin code, currently up and running at:  
https://danser-freelancer.github.io/Warframe-shawzin/  
Made by [DANser-freelancer](https://github.com/DANser-freelancer?tab=repositories) (with javascript) after attempting to have somewhat of a decent song on shawzin and feeling like my life energy was completely sucked out.  
I have all the musical scales, quality of life features, clear rules, and a database of codes. If you want to add a new song just open an issue on github.
I have created a discord server for code requests and Warframe music fans in general https://discord.gg/VyjFwKn8AY.  
And I am working on a custom bot for this server that will _possibly_ have a built in database of codes equal to the one on **Shawzin music compiler** website.  
### Credits  
Credit to [these guys](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VvlM4IQr8bfUV8pCJMVNRaG6piJTR9_t-xq7wQaxpho/edit) for having this whole shawzin code thing figured out.   
Credit to myself for finding the missing [keys](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Zd0L6b1W8ic7s9b8DKJHDBNRB-Z0tdwQEhvQl6axFCU/edit?usp=sharing) for the shawzin code, soon you will be able to program any opossible combination of shawzin notes.
